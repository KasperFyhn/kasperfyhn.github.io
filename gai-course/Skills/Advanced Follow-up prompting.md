# Advanced Follow-Up Prompting

## Importance of Advanced Follow-Up Prompting
Mastering advanced follow-up prompting is essential for refining, expanding, and elevating the quality of interactions with a GAI. Going beyond initial prompts, employing strategies like requesting examples, exploring diverse perspectives, making comparisons and contrasts, and addressing limitations enhances the precision and relevance of the information obtained.

## Examples

Incorporating diverse approaches into follow-up prompts enriches the conversation and extracts more nuanced insights.

### Requesting Examples

**Initial Prompt:**
"Explain the principles of sustainable urban planning."

**Follow-Up Prompt:**
"Can you provide specific examples of cities that have successfully implemented sustainable urban planning principles, highlighting their key achievements?"

**Why It's Effective:**
Requesting examples enhances the practical application of the information, offering tangible illustrations for better comprehension.

### Diverse Perspectives, Comparisons and Contrasts

**Initial Prompt:**
"Analyze the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market."

**Follow-Up Prompt:**
"How does the impact of AI on job markets differ between developed and developing countries? Please compare and contrast these perspectives."

**Why It's Effective:**
Seeking diverse perspectives and making comparisons and contrasts broadens the analysis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.

### Addressing Limitations

**Initial Prompt:**
"Discuss the potential applications of quantum computing in the next decade."

**Follow-Up Prompt:**
"Considering the current state of quantum computing technology, what are some acknowledged limitations or challenges that might affect its widespread adoption in various industries?"

**Why It's Effective:**
Addressing limitations acknowledges the complexity of the topic, prompting the GAI to provide a more nuanced and realistic view.

## Guiding Points

Consider these advanced follow-up prompting strategies:

1. **Requesting Examples:**
   - Prompt the GAI to provide concrete examples related to the initial response for practical illustrations.

2. **Diverse Perspectives, Comparisons, and Contrasts:**
   - Encourage the GAI to explore different viewpoints, make comparisons, and contrasts to offer a well-rounded perspective on the topic.

3. **Addressing Limitations:**
   - Acknowledge any limitations in the GAI's initial response and inquire about potential challenges or constraints associated with the topic.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Example Elicitation
Prompt the GAI with a broad question and follow up with requests for specific examples, assessing its ability to provide practical illustrations.

### Exercise 2: Comparative Analysis and Limitation Exploration
Engage the GAI in a conversation about a complex topic. Prompt it to make comparisons, contrasts, and address potential limitations, fostering a more detailed and realistic exploration.
