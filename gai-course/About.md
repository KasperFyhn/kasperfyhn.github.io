## Criteria and guidelines
When creating these materials, they were evaluated against these criteria and guidelines:

- The materials, part or whole, can be used as/in a self-enrollment course.
- The materials, part or whole, can be integrated by instructors in other courses.
- The materials should accomodate students at different educational levels and with different educational backgrounds.
- The materials should focus on hands-on learning, not a deep theoretical foundation.
- The materials are there as help and guidance for students, not as a burden.
- The contents should encourage learning and critical thinking with GAI as an aid, not as a substitute.

Design choices and individual sections have been made because of one or more of these six points.

## Usage focus
The materials are not meant for a course about generative AI as something in itself, but specifically on the use of generative AI as a student. Therefore, all content is made with practical application as the goal. 

GAI can be a tool in students' everyday life. How they can and want to use the tool is ultimately up to them. The materials can aid in building a good foundation and give just enough of a nudge for students themselves to explore and discover creative uses of GAI.

Modules are created as short, hands-on pieces of content. As such, there is little "theory" in most modules. They generally follow the structure "show, then tell". They have examples early on in order to be engaging and to show relevance, then walkthroughs/guidelines, learning perspectives to encourage a healthy integration in student life, and practical exercises. The idea is to aid the students and encourage "learning by doing" while ensuring that they are well-equipped for it.

## Modularity
The content has been made in a modular manner on purpose. This has a few drawbacks in terms of coherence and possible redundancy of content since modules do not build directly on others. But, at the same time, it has many advantages.

### Adaptability
Whether students' go through the materials by themselves or intructors integrate them in teaching, one can pick and choose from the modules depending on one's needs.  Depending on students' level and proficiency in using GAI, their educational background and lines of study, some modules may be relevant while others are not. The modularity of the content allows for versatility in practice.

To make life easier for students and instructors, there can be "pre-built" packages of modules with headlines, e.g. one for complete novices, one for students in the technical sciences, one for using GAI in long-term projects, etc.

### Common structures
The modules are not just a mix of anything. They have been categorized into _Use cases_ for guiding the students useful and tangible ways of working with GAI, _Skills_ for helping students refine their prompting techniques, and _Concerns_ for encouring a responsible use of a new technology. Modules within a category have the same structure.

### Expandability
The content can easily be expanded without making many changes for it to fit in with the rest of the content. 
A category can be expanded with new modules, and new categories can even be added. Individual modules can be expanded or edited without affecting other modules.

### Maintainability
Additionally, the field of AI moves rapidly. Some information may be outdated while there are gaping holes of missing information. Hopefully, the modularity of the content will make maintenance less troublesome since modules are largely independent from each other.

## Questions and critique points

### Much of the content is pretty obvious
Perhaps. You may find that much of the content is obvious, especially as you become more adept at using GAI. It is to help you, and everyone else, avoid common pitfalls and give a nudge towards effective use of GAI.

### What about use-case X or skill Y?
The use-cases and skills are far from exhaustive. They are there to serve as initial guidance and inspiration. The possibilities are numerous. Students know best how GAI is best integrated in their workflow.

### This is too vague or too specific
A big challenge has been to make the materials in such a way that it is relevant to students in various disciplines. We wanted the content to be as generalizable as possible, while being specific enough to seem anchored in the real world in order to show how it makes sense in practice. Sometimes, the content has gone too much in one direction.
