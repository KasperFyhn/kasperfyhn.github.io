# Privacy concerns

## Examples

### Good Example
A student uses a generative AI tool to help brainstorm ideas for a research paper. The student inputs a generic prompt related to the topic of the paper, such as “Discuss the impact of climate change on agriculture.” The AI generates a list of points that the student can consider when writing the paper. 

In this case, the student’s privacy is maintained as the input to the AI does not contain any personal or sensitive information.

### Bad Example
A student uses a generative AI tool to write a personal essay about a difficult life experience. The student inputs detailed personal information into the AI to generate the essay.

In this case, there is a privacy concern because the AI tool could potentially store, process, or share the sensitive personal information inputted by the student.

## Why it is relevant
Generative AI tools can be powerful aids in the learning process, but it’s important to be aware of privacy concerns. These tools often require input data to generate outputs. If this input data contains sensitive or personal information, it could potentially be stored, processed, or shared, leading to privacy concerns. Therefore, it’s crucial to use these tools responsibly and avoid inputting sensitive personal information.

Remember, while generative AI can be a powerful tool for enhancing productivity, it’s essential to use it responsibly to protect your privacy.

## Practical Exercises
1. Brainstorm a list of topics that you could safely use a generative AI tool to assist with. Consider the potential privacy implications of each topic.
1. Write a short paragraph using a generative AI tool. Reflect on the information you inputted into the tool and whether it could raise any privacy concerns.
1. Review your university’s policy on the use of AI tools and identify any guidelines related to privacy. If no guidelines exist, consider what guidelines could be helpful to protect student privacy.
