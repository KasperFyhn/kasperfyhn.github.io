# Use cases

The possibilities are near endless.

These modules will introduce you to different use cases of GAI in your everyday student life. Maybe they will hit the mark for ways that you would want to use GAI, or maybe they can just serve as inspiration.

The modules present one or more examples, followed by a walk-through, learning perspectives, and finally practical exercises.
