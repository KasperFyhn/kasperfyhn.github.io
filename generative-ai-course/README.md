# Using generative AI as a student

The contents of this project are meant to serve as the basis for materials on using generative AI as a (university) student. Students can go through the contents in a self-enrollment course, or instructors can pick and choose from the modules and integrate them in teaching. 

It is aimed at students at all levels and with different educational backgrounds. Whether a novice or an expert when it comes to using generative AI, the modules can help students discover ways to enchance their studies, refine their prompting skills and techniques, and guide them towards a healthy and responsible use of GAI.

The contents are created as short learning modules with a hands-on approach and are divided into three categories:
1. **Use cases**: practical use cases - _what_ you can do with GAI.
1. **Skills**: refinement of prompt engineering skills  - _how_ you can do it.
1. **Considerations**: concerns and considerations that are relevant for most students to be aware of.

The _About_ document contains details on how and why the materials have been made the way they are.
